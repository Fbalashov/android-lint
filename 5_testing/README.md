# 6. Testing

Testing is an important activity in software development. This counts in particular for custom Lint rules, since they validate your code for convention flaws and other defects.

For a long time there exists no convenient way to test custom Lint rules. But fortunately 2015 Google released an [official library](https://bintray.com/android/android-tools/com.android.tools.lint.lint-tests/view) for testing custom Lint rules at end of May 2015. This version unfortunately had some [dependency issues](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=175161) which got fixed by version 24.3.0 at end of July 2015. **So make please sure to use this version or above.**

##Test library dependency
In order to use **lint-tests** library add the following lines to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    ...
    maven {
        url  'https://dl.bintray.com/android/android-tools'
    }
}

dependencies {
    ...
    testCompile 'com.android.tools.lint:lint-tests:24.3.0'
}
```

**Note:** You need to add the Android tools repository `https://dl.bintray.com/android/android-tools` to the repository section of your `build.gradle`. Just `jcenter()` is not sufficient.

##Unit test
The following example demonstrate the basic test principles. It's taken from the CustomLintRule template project [1]:

```java
public class HelloWorldDetectorTest extends LintDetectorTest {

  //specify the Detector you want to test
  @Override protected Detector getDetector() {
    return new HelloWorldDetector();
  }

  //specify the Issues you want to test
  @Override protected List<Issue> getIssues() {
    return Arrays.asList(HelloWorldDetector.ISSUE);
  }

  //this needs to be overridden (see https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=182195)
  @Override protected InputStream getTestResource(String relativePath, boolean expectExists) {
    String path = relativePath; //$NON-NLS-1$
    InputStream stream = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(path);
    if (!expectExists && stream == null) {
      return null;
    }
    return stream;
  }

  //assert that your custom Lint rule generates the expected output
  public void testShouldDetectNoWarning() throws Exception {
    assertEquals("No warnings.", lintFiles("ValidAndroidManifest.xml=>AndroidManifest.xml"));
  }
```

1. A test class needs to extend `LintDetectorTest`.
2. `getDetector()` needs to be overwritten and return the `Detector` which should be tested.
3. `getIssues()` is required to be overwritten and to return the `Issues` which should be tested.
4. Due to [an issue](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=182195) with the loading of test resources the `getTestResource()` method needs to be overwritten and use the actual `ClassLoader` to load the test resources.
5. An assertions is performed on the result of `lintFiles()` which takes a list of relative file names to test as argument and returns the resulting output as `String`.<br/>
*Note: By using an `=>` operator within the file `String` this file gets renamed when getting processed by Lint. This is useful for .java or .class files. You could store them with a .txt suffix for instance and rename them on the fly if you need to.*

More examples on how to test custom Lint rules can be found in [Android's Lint test source code](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/base/+/master/lint/cli/src/test/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/). The complete example from above is demonstrated in the CustomLintRule template project [1].
