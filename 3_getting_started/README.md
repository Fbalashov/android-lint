# 3. Getting started
After the [introduction into using/configuring the Lint tool](../1_introduction/) and some [basics on the core principles of the Lint API](../2_lint_api_basics) let's get you started writing custom Android Lint rules.

There is no need to start from scratch. Just use [this Gradle-based project template](https://github.com/a11n/CustomLintRules.git) to get started.

It should be sufficient documented and self-explaining. In case you are still missing something you are welcome to [submit an issue](https://github.com/a11n/CustomLintRules/issues/new) with wishes or improvements.
